# landing-page
Landing page based on the design from The Odin Project.

This layout was recreated by being given an image of the layout, colors, and font styles.

Made in vanilla Javascript, HTML, CSS.

## Things learned
This project helped me get used to the CSS Box model. 
Initially I was overwhelmed by the different sections displayed on the layout page.
Finding that each section could be separated into boxes helped manage the project into smaller portions.

By using `flex-direction: column` I was able to work my way from the top to bottom focusing on each section.
I was able to practice identifying that each section was a set of even smaller boxes laid out in a specific way.

My work flow process was to complete the HTML for one section first, then stylize it with CSS.
After completing one section I would move on and adjust the previous section as needed.
